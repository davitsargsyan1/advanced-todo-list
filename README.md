**Build an Advanced Todo List Application** Overview:

Develop a sophisticated Todo List application using React. The app should allow users to organize their tasks into categories, set priorities, and filter tasks based on different criteria. The application must be fully client-side and make use of local storage to persist data.

Objectives:

- **Task Management**: Enable users to create, edit, delete, and categorize tasks.
- **Prioritization**: Allow users to assign priorities to tasks and display them accordingly.
- **Filters**: Implement filters to view tasks by category, priority, or completion status.
- **State Management**: Use Redux Toolkit for managing application state efficiently.
- **User Experience**: Include animations and transitions to enhance the UX (use drag and drop, sth like that you can see in Jira or Trello).
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the application is fully responsive and provides a seamless experience across all device sizes.
- **Persistence**: Use local storage to save and load tasks.

Technical Specifications:

- **Frontend Framework**: React (latest stable version)
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit or Context API
- **Styling**: Andt for ‘ready for use’ components, for additional styling use styled-components.
- **Routing**: React Router (latest version) for managing different views (e.g., separate route to view single task )

Deliverables:

- **Source Code**: Well-structured source code.
- **Documentation**: A README file that includes:
  - Setup instructions
  - An overview of the project structure
- **Demo**: A live demo hosted on a platform like Vercel or Netlify.

Evaluation Criteria:

- **Functionality**: All features work as specified without errors.
- **Code Quality**: Code is clean, modular, and follows best practices.
- **Performance**: Application handles state updates efficiently without performance degradation.
